Microservices-Clinic
Implementation of medical unit administration system based on Spring Framework.
The system is set up as distributed microservices architecture with use of Spring Boot tools.
Main functionality of that system is registration of users(patients, doctors),
managing doctors calendars and registering patients for visits.

This is typical implementation of Netflix Eureka registry. In simple words, 
in my opinion, this is a simple version of DNS for a microservice :)
